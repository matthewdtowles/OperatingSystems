1 – Select directory
The user is prompted for a directory [absolute] name. 
This is the first options that must be selected by the user. 
All the options below are working on the directory selected here. 
After performing several operations on the selected directory, 
the user can select another directory and work with it.

2 – List directory content (first level)
This option displays the content of the selected directory on the screen. 
All the files and sub-directories from the first level must be displayed 
(files and directories should be listed separately). 
If no directory was selected an error message must be displayed.

3 – List directory content (all levels)
This option displays the content of the selected directory on the screen. 
All the files and sub-directories from the first and subsequent levels must be 
displayed (files and directories should be listed separately). 
If no directory was selected an error message must be displayed.

4 – Delete file
This option prompts the user for a filename and deletes that file from the 
selected directory. 
If no directory was selected an error message must be displayed. 
If the directory does not contain the file specified by the user, 
an error message must be displayed. 
The filename does not include any path, it’s just the name of the file.

5 – Display file (hexadecimal view)
This option prompts the user for a filename (from the selected directory) 
and displays the content of that file on the screen, in hexadecimal view. 
If no directory was selected an error message must be displayed. 
If the directory does not contain the file specified by the user, 
an error message must be displayed. 
The filename does not include any path, it’s just the name of the file.
Note 1: The hexadecimal view displays each byte of the file in hexadecimal; 
Note2: The ASCII representation, the Current Offset and the Value Preview are NOT required; 
also there is no window, no graphics, no colors, just black and white text display. 
Being a text only display, you are required to display ONLY the Data Offset and 
the Hexadecimal Representation.

6 – Encrypt file (XOR with password)
This option prompts the user for a password 
(max 256 bytes long, may contain letters, digits, other characters) 
and then prompts the user for a filename and encrypts the content of the 
selected file using that password. The encryption method is very simple: 
just XOR the password with the file content byte after byte; 
the password being shorter than the file content, you must repeat the password 
as needed.
Example:
passwordpasswordpasswordpasswordpasswordpasswordpass
this is the file content that we need to encrypt now
chiphertext is obtained here by XORing byte to byte
Note1: the user must be prompted for the filename of the encrypted file 
(containing the ciphertext) as well, otherwise we would need to overwrite the initial file.
Note2: If no directory was selected an error message must be displayed. 
If the directory does not contain either of the files specified by the user, 
an error message must be displayed. The filenames do not include any path.

7 – Decrypt file (XOR with password)
This option prompts the user for a password 
(max 256 bytes long, may contain letters, digits, other characters) 
and then prompts the user for a filename and decrypts the content of the 
selected file using that password. The decryption method is very simple: 
just XOR the password with the file content byte after byte; the password being 
shorter than the file content, you must repeat the password as needed.
Example:
passwordpasswordpasswordpasswordpasswordpasswordpass
chiphertext is here …
this is the file content that we had initially
Note1: the user must be prompted for the filename of the decrypted file as well, 
otherwise we would need to overwrite the initial file.
Note2: it may seem strange that we are using the same operation (XOR) both for 
encryption and for decryption, but this is how XOR (exclusive OR) works.
Note3: If no directory was selected an error message must be displayed. 
If the directory does not contain either of the files specified by the user, 
an error message must be displayed. The filenames do not include any path.

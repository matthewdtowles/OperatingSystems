Deliverables:
1. source code
2. report.doc - containing:
    introduction and an overview of the project
    a comprehensive description of the design and implementation
3. test document w/:
    screensots show execution 4 algorithms using the inputs from HW6
        3 screenshots for each algorithm: 
            i. shows beginning of the simulation
            ii. in the middle of the simulation 
            iii. one showing the end of the simulation.
4. test doc containing screensots:
    - show the execution of the 4 algorithms using the following inputs: 
        N=5, ref. string is: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 9 1 8 2 7 3 6 4 5 
        - 3 screenshots for each algorithm: 
            i. shows the beginning of the simulation
            ii. one in the middle of the simulation
            iii. one showing the end of the simulation.

Pick one scheduling algorithm and give us your opinion about it; use different points of view (interactive/batch, slow/fast, easy/difficult to implement/understand, etc.)

The post should reflect your own understanding, use your own words (don't repeat paragraphs from the online material or the eReadings).

If you pick an algorithm that was already chosen (and posted) by another colleague, your post should be original (try covering different angles, give some examples, etc.). 

OR : Suggest a new scheduling algorithm. Show its advantages and disadvantages.
